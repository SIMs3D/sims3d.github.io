3D4EM is a research project funded by [STW](http://www.stw.nl) in which 14 [organisations](/partners) (universities, governement and companies) are working together to develop a countrywide and scalable 3D information infrastructure (SDI) for integrated 3D environmental modelling. This will enable easy use---and reuse---of 3D data to serve a wide variety of users and applications, and permit environmental software packages to better account for the third dimension.

The project is divided into 3 research lines
