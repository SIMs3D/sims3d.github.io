The <a href="http://www.isprs2016-prague.com/">XXIII ISPRS congress</a> held in Prague in mid-July has been the opportunity for several restructuring in the organizational chart of the international society. One important change is the setting of 5 Technical Commissions for 2016 to 2020, that is 3 commissions less than the previous years. The <a href="http://www2.isprs.org/commissions.html">new commissions</a> are established as follows:  Sensor Systems (Com. I), Photogrammetry (Com. II), Remote Sensing (Com. III), Spatial Information Science (Com. IV) and Education and outreach (Com. V).
