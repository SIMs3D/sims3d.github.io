On tuesday, 13th of October, people from TU Delft, University of Twente and Leap3D went to a fire brigade in Berkel en Rodenrijs to perform some laser scanning of the building.
The goal is to produce a 3D model that can be used as an example model for tools developed in the SIMs3D project.

The performance of the ZEB1 was amazing. The entire building could be scanned in one hour and a half. The resuting point cloud was also quite convincing.
