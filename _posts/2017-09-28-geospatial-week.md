The 2017 edition of the <a href="http://gsw2017.3snews.net/">ISPRS Geospatial Week</a>, was held in Wuhan (China) from the 18th to the 22nd of September. The event hosted several workshops (including <a href="http://indoor3d.net/2017/">Indoor 3D 2017</a>) and allowed, once again, to gather all the important actors in GIS, academic or profesional, worldwide. Similarly as last year, the SIMs3D project have brought a large contribution to the event with more than five papers and posters. Among them was the contribution of Shayan (see picture below), related to the <a href="http://www.sims3d.net/rl1/">research line 1</a>, who has delivered a remarquable presentation that was rewarded with the price of the best paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-2-W4-355-2017">(which can be accessed here)</a> .

This confirms the very productive year of the SIMs3D project after the <a href="http://www.sims3d.net/news/FFS-paper/">recent important publication</a> related to the research line 2 as well. 
Several other related papers were also presented during the <a href="http://indoor3d.net/2017/">Indoor 3D 2017 Workshop</a>. They are resulting from the fructful collaborations with researchers and MSc students from diverse horizons, made easy by the IndoorLab meetings held regularly in TU Delft.

The list of the closely related papers can be found in the <a href="http://www.sims3d.net/publications/">Publications</a> page and the exhaustive lists of all the papers of the event can be found <a href="https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W4/">here (for the Annals)</a> and <a href="https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-2-W7/">there (for the Archives)</a>.
