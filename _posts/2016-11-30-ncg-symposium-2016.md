The Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of the University of Twente (<a href="https://www.itc.nl/">ITC</a>) hosted the <a href="http://www.ncgeo.nl/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=2721:ncg-symposium-2016-programme&Itemid=393&lang=en">NCG Symposium 2016</a>, on November 30th in Eschede. 
The event gathered several Masters, PhDs and postdocs students of the Netherlands that presented their work, covering a large scope of GIS topics. It was a good opportunity for the MSc students that contributed (among them, Olivier and Florian in the top images) to the SIMs3 project to present their work, after they successfully completed their thesis. 
Shayan and Abdoulaye (bottom images) could also present the last results of their research. The final versions of the Msc thesis can be found in <a href="http://www.sims3d.net/related/">this page</a>.
