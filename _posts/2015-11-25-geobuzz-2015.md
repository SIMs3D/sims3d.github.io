On 24th and 25th of november 2015 took place the second edition of the <a href="http://geobuzz.nl/">GeoBuzz</a> conference, held in the 1931 Congrescentrum building in 's-Hertogenbosch (The Netherlands). 
The GeoBuzz event allows to an important number of professionnal and academic actors in Geoscience to meet, share sharp edge knowledges and technologies and discuss ongoing problems and future improvements.  
As an active contributor in research, the 3D GeoInformation team from TU Delft was represented through several sessions covering different topics in GIS. 
SIMs3D, as part of the Maps4Society project were also presented during a session dedicated to all the works in the scope of Maps4Society. The subdivision of the space were discussed, allowing to get 
a first feedback from people with scientific and technical backgrounds. A copy of the presentation can be found in the publication page.
