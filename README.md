# www.3d4em.nl website

Uses [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) to generate static pages.

It is automatically linked to `www.3d4em.nl`, thus if the master branch is updated then the website is updated.


## Adding news posts

Each blog/news post is a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) file in `_posts`. When creating one, just copy the structure of the other ones, the naming convention for the files must be followed and each file should have a header of this form:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Testing..1..2..testing"
categories: news
date:   2014-11-20
author: John Smith
---
```

To write markdown and see right-away the result, use that very handy [website](http://dillinger.io).
